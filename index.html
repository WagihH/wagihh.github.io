            <em>May - August 2021</em>

            <strong> Grinnell, IA </strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
            Under the supervision of Dr. Shonda Kuiper, I produced content that teaches undergraduate level students machine learning classification (ML) algorithms, such as CART, random forest, and logistic regression; furthermore, utilizing HTML, PHP, and MySQL, I created webpages that interact with an SQL Database.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ML content is centered around model creation, validation, and optimization and highlights the importance of checking models for bias.
            COMPAS, a classification algorithm used by many U.S. jurisdictions to predict the likelihood of a convicted individual recidivating, has a significantly high false positive rate for Black individuals. 
            The content allows students to explore the results of research done around COMPAS and informs them of how bias was able to creep its way into the model.
            Utilizing R, we created interactive Shiny applications for students to create different classification models to predict recidivism, compare between models using ROC curves, and assess differing accuracy metrics through cross validation.

              <br>
              <br>
              The Mann, Bradley and Hughes’ (MBH, 1998) highly cited ‘hockey-stick shaped’ graph showed a drastic increase in surface temperatures post-industrial revolution.
              While climate change may be one of the largest obstacles for humans to overcome, the techniques used to create these graphs had fundamental flaws when standardizing data. 
              With a group of peers, we recreated and furthered McIntyre and McKitrick's (2003) by conducting a principal component analysis (PCA) simulation and analyzing the probability of falsely obtaining a hockey-stick shaped graph.
              <br>
              <br>
              We generated a 581-by-70 matrix, with the 70 columns representing randomly created red-noise data from an autoregression and the 581 rows representing years. 
              We average and then standardize each series, the values in the 70 columns, at each row. 
              When standardizing, we use MBH's technique and compute Z-scores based on the mean of the last 40, 79, and 140 years. 
              The principal components were then created from randomly selected series and compared to those from a centered dataset, which was properly standardized. 
              We observed no hockey-stick shaped graphs when standardizing from the last 140 years, 71(±1)% hockey-stick shaped graphs when standardizing from the last 79 years, and ~100% when standardizing from the last 40 years.
              For the centered data, there were no hockey-stick shaped graphs. 
              This study confirmed the impact of improper standardization in MBH98 and that research should be properly validated before becoming widely accepted.

                  <em>2019, 2020</em> 
                  <br>
                  <strong> Grinnell, IA </strong> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  With a group of peers, I participated in the Grinnell College Pioneer Weekend competition in 2019 and 2020.
                  The competition is a three day long startup pitch competition where students collaborate on a startup idea and present it to a panel of various business professionals.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In 2019, my group devised a plan for a mobile application called HERO. 
                  This application would allow users to track their environmental impact based on their consumption of goods, give recommendations on how to be more environmentally friendly, and give users access to coupons designed to promote sustainability.
                  Our business plan included a statistical analysis of a survey taken from our target demographic, market sizing, a rollout plan, and projected cash flow estimates.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In 2020, we designed a plan for a browser extension called Verify. 
                  As this project was slightly before the presidential election, my team wanted to create something that would help people make more informed decisions.
                  Verify would use machine learning algorithms, likely a bayesian analysis, to estimate the likelihood of a social media post containing false information.
                  The extension would monetize by linking users to credible news outlets when a post is flagged as a high risk for fake news. 
                  The construction of our presentation also included a survey analysis, market sizing, a rollout plan, projected cash flows, and an exit strategy (selling the idea to social media firms as an API).

                  <br>
                  With the collaboration of 4 peers, I had the opportunity to compete in this case competition as the first ever Grinnell College representing team. 
                  The case was centered around helping a firm become more sustainable or ethical. 
                  My team choose American Express and came up with the idea of the AmEx Next Card -- a credit card with the ambition of helping and rewarding customers for making sustainable purchases.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  With over 300 hours of combined work, we crafted a 30 minute, 10 minute, and 90 second long presentation to administer to business executives around the Los Angeles area, as well as a comprehensive executive summary and rollout plan.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Though we did not place in this competition, it was incredibly beneficial in developing presentation, business, and PowerPoint skills, and is one of my most enjoyable experiences to date.
